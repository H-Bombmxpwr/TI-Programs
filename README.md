# Calculator Programs Compilation

## Program Categories

This repository contains a variety of programs designed for **physics and mathematics**,  with some games too. Each program is stored in its respective folder and includes a **text file** explaining how to use it.

## Contributors

This folder contains programs that were made by:

- **Hunter Baisden** (Class of 2020)
- **Liam Cacioppo** (Class of 2020)
- **John Schmidt** (Class of 2016)
- And a few that were pulled from other outside sources, or just completely unknown.

All credit for a given program is listed in the description of that program.

**Programs compiled together by Hunter.**

## Storage and Memory Management

All programs take up a certain amount of space—some more than others—and can quickly fill up your calculator’s **RAM storage**. The calculator runs all operations from RAM, including variables and lists.

However, your calculator also has **ARCHIVE storage**, which acts as deep storage. Your calculator has much more of this storage, but **ARCHIVED** programs cannot be used until moved to RAM.

### Managing Storage

Follow these steps to manage RAM and ARCHIVE storage:

1. On the home screen, press `2nd` and then the `+` button (`mem`).
2. Select `Mem Management/Delete..` (CE) or `Mem Mgmt/Del...` (TI-84+).
3. Scroll down to `Prgm...` (7th option) and select it.

You will see something like:

```
RAM FREE     23674
ARC FREE     1346K

    ACLEAR    517
    AHQUADC   2754
    BINOEXP   8860
```

- **RAM FREE**: Amount of available RAM.
- **ARC FREE**: Amount of available ARCHIVE storage.
- The numbers next to the programs indicate their storage size.

### Moving Programs Between RAM and ARCHIVE

- Select a program and press `Enter` to move it **from RAM to ARCHIVE** (a `*` will appear).
- Select a program with `*` and press `Enter` to move it **from ARCHIVE back to RAM** (if there is enough space).
- To delete a program permanently, highlight it and press the `del` button.

## Transferring Programs to Your Calculator

To transfer programs, you need:

- **USB 2.0 A Male to Mini B Male Power Charging and Data Cable**
- **TI-Connect CE Software** (Free download: [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw))

### Steps to Transfer Programs

1. Download and install the **TI-Connect CE** software.
2. Plug the calculator into your computer using the USB cable.
3. Open **Calculator Explorer Workspace** in the software.
4. Drag and drop the programs from the folder into the **gray list** on the right side.
5. The programs will be sent to your calculator.

## Running Programs

### Running a Program

1. On the home screen, press the `prgm` button.
2. Scroll to the program you want to run and select it.
3. The program will appear on the home screen.
4. Press `Enter` again to execute the program.

### Common Issues

- **Ensure the program is the only thing on the home screen.**  
  - Example of an error: `2+2prgmACLEAR`
  - Solution: Clear the screen before running the program.

- **If a program gets stuck in an infinite loop,** press the `on` button to **terminate** it immediately.

## Additional Notes

- Programs stored in **ARCHIVE** must be moved to **RAM** before running.
- Keep an eye on **RAM FREE** to ensure you have enough space.
- If you no longer need a program, delete it to free up space.

Enjoy!
