HSERIES has multiple uses. 

Finite Solver will ask for a function, a lower and upper bound, and an increment.
It will then output the first few terms, the mean, median, sum, and standard deviation. 

Arithmetric and Geometric will take the first term and the common difference/ratio and 
output the rule of the function, the first 5 terms and the end behavior. 

Fibonacci will give the nth term of the fibonacci sequence

Series tester asks for at least 4 terms and then it will decide if it is arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, Fibonacci or none of those.
