AHQUADC is a small compact version that gets the job done quickly and effectively. AHQUAD Universal is much larger, but offers many extra features
and calculations that didn't fit in AHQUADC. Choose whichever one you want/have space for. 

Both are Quadratic Solvers. Enter in the coefficents a,b and c of a quadratic in standard form
and these programs will:

1. Find the zeros(real or imaginary)
2. Find the vertex
3. Find the discriminant
4. Find the domain and range
5. Find the focus point and diretrix
6. Simpify into vertex and intercept form
7. Graph the function(DISCLAIMER: not much formatting is put to make the graph look nice in AHQUADC to keep the program small)
8. Stores all calculated values to variables to be used later

AHQUAD Universal will do much more than this, including calculus applications.
