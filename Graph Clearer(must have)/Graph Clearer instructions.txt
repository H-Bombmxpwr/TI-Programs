Run AACLEAR if your graph is messed up in any way, it will fix it and clear all of your
"y=" functions. It will also erase any drawings on the graph. The CE version will not work on
the 84+ and vice versa so make sure to take the right one for your calculator. This program is 
very useful to tidy up your graph screen if it has been altered by a program.

84+ = AACLEAR
CE = AACLEARC
