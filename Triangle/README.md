## TRIANGLE NEW Program

**TRIANGLE NEW** is a powerful tool for solving triangles in multiple ways. It allows users to:

- Input any **three or more known parts** of a triangle (sides or angles), and the program will **calculate the missing values**.
- Enter **three 2D points** in the same plane, and it will:
  - Compute the **lengths of all three sides**.
  - Determine the **three angles** of the triangle.
  - Calculate the **area** of the triangle.

For unknown values, simply input `X` into the prompt, and the program will solve for the missing parts automatically.
