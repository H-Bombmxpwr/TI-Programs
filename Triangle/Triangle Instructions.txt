The normal TRIANGLE is John Schmidt's orginal program. It will prompt for any 3 or more parts of
a triangle and it will solve for the the missing parts(a part being an angle or side). If the part is unknown, input X into the input
field. Capital letters represent angles and lowercase letters represent sides.

Program TRIANGLE New is the exact same as the original, except Hunter added an additonal function.
You can now input any 3 2D points in the same plane and it will give the lengths of the 3 sides,
the 3 angles of the triangle, and the area of the triangle.
