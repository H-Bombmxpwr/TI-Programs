HPHYSICS is a comprehensive physics program for AP physics 1 and C. It also includes a complete breakdown of units as well as
Newton's Laws, Kepler's Laws, and the laws of thermodynamics. Works on all calculators.

Because HPHYSICS is so large, I split it into 3 programs, HPHYS1, HPHYS2, and HPHYS3. These are identical to HPHYSICS, just split
into 3 parts to help with space management. If you have the space, take HPHYSICS, but if space is an issue take it in parts and
arhive/unarchive them when necessary.
