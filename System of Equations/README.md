SYSTEMS will solve 2 and 3 variable equations by only entering the coefficents of the equations.
When entering equations make sure that all of the coefficents line up when entering them into the program. 

If a system has no solution or infinitely many solution the program will tell you this. 

If it has infinitely many solutions it will give a parameterized answer for all of the possible answers.
