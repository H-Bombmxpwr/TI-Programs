This program calculates Riemann sums when a function or table is inputted. 

When entering a function make sure it is in terms of x, as it only excepts function in the form
f(x) = ...... 
The function section wil output the Left, Right, Mid, and Trap estimations as well as the actual area for any interval and number of subintervals.


In the table section, once entering the number of columns, make sure that the x values are from left to right and that the f(x) values also
are from left to right and correspond to the inputted x values. The table function will output the Left, Right, and Trapezoidal estimations.
